# analysis-checkmarx-scan-fix
Checkmarx scans to identify vulnerabilities in code and provides validation mechanisms for critical inputs

Checkmarx Scan

## Overview
This repository contains a Python application that validates command ingestion parameters, including `application_name`, `region_key`, `configuration`, OS-related file paths, and database connection strings. Security measures are implemented to prevent risks such as OS access violations, invalid file paths, and unsafe connection strings. Additionally, Checkmarx scans are integrated to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

## Features
### Command Validation
- Validates `sys.argv` inputs for `application_name`, `region_key`, and `configuration`.
- Ensures OS path inputs are sanitized to prevent access violations.
- Implements file validation to confirm the existence and integrity of files.

### Connection String Validation
- Parses and validates database connection strings for secure ingestion.
- Prevents injection attacks by sanitizing user-provided connection strings.
- Supports validation for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other database formats.

### Checkmarx Integration
- Runs Checkmarx Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans.
- Supports ingestion mode for SARIF-format results normalization and deduplication.
- Provides detailed reports on security vulnerabilities.
